# About the project
The Stochastic Petri Net Package (SPNP) is an adaptable and versatile modelling tool 
for the solution of Stochastic Reward Nets (SRNs). The package has been used by many 
different research facilities and organizations around the world to study and model 
complex concurrent processes in a real distributed system. However, this popular 
package can only generate an analytic-numeric solution for the SRN models 
implemented in it, which causes a problem when the state space of the system 
becomes too large; in which case, only simulation modelling methods are useful. This 
thesis project provides a solution to this problem by adding discrete-event simulation 
capabilities to the SRN models implemented in the SPNP package. The simulation 
methodology is useful in particular, for non-Markovian SRNs. Discrete Event System 
Specification (DEVS) is the simulation formalism used to reach at this solution. This Github 
project provides an approach to integrate two systems namely: the SPNP package and 
the DEVS engine, with discrete-event simulation capabilities. The solution is achieved 
via the use of a parser that establishes a stable communication between these two 
systems and initiates simulation for the input SRN models from the SPNP package in 
the DEVS engine. Download the project [here](https://github.com/nikhil-jain-k/DEVS-Based-Simulation-of-SPN-models).

## Functionality Testing Results
The following table breifly represents the results from the example models SRN models in the SPNP package. The detailed results can be viewed in the folder of each model in this repository. The .c files are the CSPL files generated for the model from the SPNP package, the .out files are the analytic-numeric solution generated by SPNP package, and the .txt files are the saved 
simulation results from the DEVS engine for the particular model.
